Description
===========

This is a svn2git import of [Garrett Honeycutt's][1] [vim syntax SVN repo][2]
for the Puppet DSL (.pp files).  That repo itself appears to be an import and
refactoring of Luke Kanies' [puppet.vim][2].  It appears that the original puppet.vim has evolved since it was imported into SVN.
