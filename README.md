Description
===========

This is a svn2git import of [Garrett Honeycutt][1]'s [vim puppet syntax SVN
repo][2] for the Puppet DSL (.pp files).  That repo itself appears to be an
import and refactoring of Luke Kanies' [puppet.vim][2].  It appears that the
original puppet.vim has evolved since it was imported into SVN.
